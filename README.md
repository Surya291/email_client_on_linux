Note  : Generating an app-specific-password for Mutt

If we are using google two-factor authentication, to be able to access our gmail account from Mutt, we need to generate an app-specific-password, since google requires it for the applications that donâ€™t use Oauth2 as authentication method. To generate an app-specific-password, just navigate to the link provided below , authenticate yourself, and follow the instructions to generate the password: we will use it in the configuration.
